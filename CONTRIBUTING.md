## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
